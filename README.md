# Figma2Android

This tool was created as part of a bachelor thesis in computer engineering at Karlstad University for a local office of a major tech company. 

## Purpose
The purpose of the tool is to automatically convert UI prototypes from Figma into functional Android XML code. By integrating with Figma's API, the tool recursively converts designs from JSON into hierarchical XML structures. 

## Collaboration
This tool was developed together with a thesis partner, where the workload was split evenly. Therefore, I am not solely responsible for its capabilities as it is a result of a collaborative effort between two students.
